  <h2>Making a set of wooden coasters inspired by a chess board and diagonal pad
</h2>
  <span class="post-date">21 February 2017 00:00:00 -0700</span>
  <p><p>Howdy, and welcome to the first installment of my new segment,
‚ÄúThis Old Blog‚Äù, where I talk all things wood. From projects
I'm working on to tools and techniques I love, I'll cover it all.</p>
<p>I'm going to kick this new segment off by showing a set of coasters I
recently made. These were inspired first by a chess board, but after I
started gluing, a diagonal pad also came to mind. The coasters are made
of alternating walnut and mahogany. I also added a border, but to be
perfectly honest, I am unsure of the species. I think it might be some
species of pine but that is only a guess based on pictures online.</p>
<p>Before I get too deep into the coasters, I do want to plug the local
lumberyard I frequent,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.moxonhardwoods.com/">Moxon Hardwoods</a>.</p>
<blockquote>

and Lumber needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm fairly new to hardwoods and &quot;exotic&quot; woods especially. The folks at Moxon
were and are extremely nice and helpful with any questions I had. One of the
things I love most about them is they have what I call an &quot;odds and sods&quot; pile.
This wood isn't necessarily scrap, but is usually in shorter lengths and harder
for them to sell. I've seen this sold as &quot;mill ends&quot; some places.</p>
<p>This is perfect for folks like me because I can get a nice variety of woods
at a decent price. If you live in Portland, Oregon or the surrounding areas, I
can't recommend Moxon Hardwoods enough. Now onto the project.</p>
<h2>Hey, careful man, there's a beverage here!</h2>
<p>I started the coaster set by cutting
square blocks that were about 7/8&quot; wide and 5&quot; long. I then glued these up
in sets of three and alternated between walnut and mahogany. I made
two sets that were walnut-mahogany-walnut and one that was
mahogany-walnut-mahogany to achieve a chess board pattern.</p>

  </a>
</div>
<p>After finishing the main block, I thought the coaster was a bit small
at just under 3&quot; and decided to add a border. I'm not 100% sure on the species
of this wood, but it has a beautiful grain so I decided to try it.</p>
<p>If anyone happens to know exactly what this species is, please
<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/rjgoldsborough">tweet me</a>!</p>
<p>I will also post my twitter handle at the end of the article, and it can also be
found in the footer.</p>

<p>I'll admit I did eyeball the border cuts. There is a mark on my miter saw that
I use that is between 5/32nds and 3/16ths. While each cut wasn't exactly the same
size, the difference was negligible to me.</p>

  </a>
</div>
<p>After gluing the border on, I was
left with a beautiful, solid block of wood ready to be sliced into coasters.</p>
<p>Before slicing, I gave the block a rough sanding with 60 grit sandpaper to
try and even everything out the best I could.</p>
<p>After gluing all this together, the end obviously wasn't flat and I decided to
take a test cut at the same mark I used for the border cuts.</p>
<p>I did this for two reasons. 1) This gave me a flat face on the block, and 2) It
allowed me to test the thickness of each coaster.</p>
<p>I thought that was too thin so I decided to bump it up to 1/4&quot; to allow for a
bit of sanding. This seemed thick when measuring but turned out to be a great
thickness for them.</p>

</div>
<p>I ended up with about 12 coasters and some of the block leftover. I currently
only have a miter saw, and the block started to get small and I didn't feel
comfortable moving my hand closer to the blade.</p>
<p>I wanted a rough idea of what they would look like finished, so I rubbed one down
with a wet rag. I liked what I was seeing.</p>
<div>
  <a href="/static/images/chess-board-coaster-set/originals/nine.jpg"
    target="_blank">
    <img src="/static/images/chess-board-coaster-set/nine_thumb.jpg" />
  </a>
</div>
<p>I sanded the first coaster to 800 grit and applied a heavy coat of boiled
linseed oil with a rag. I let this sit for about 20 minutes, then I rubbed
off the excess oil with another clean rag. The next day I lightly sanded the
coaster again with the 800 grit sandpaper. I then followed the same procedure
as before to apply a second coat. I've considered a third coat, but am sticking
with two for the time being.</p>

<p>I'm getting the light so I think that's my time. All in all, I'm very happy with
how these coasters turned out. There are things I could have done differently
and probably better, sure, but I think they look great and I also learned some
things.</p>

with any questions or comments you might have... or if you can confirm my guess
of pine.</p>
