Howdy, and welcome to the first installment of my new segment, 
&ldquo;This Old Blog&rdquo;, where I talk all things wood. From projects
I'm working on to tools and techniques I love, I'll cover it all.

I'm going to kick this new segment off by showing a set of coasters I
recently made. These were inspired first by a chess board, but after I 
started gluing, a diagonal pad also came to mind. The coasters are made
of alternating walnut and mahogany. I also added a border, but to be
perfectly honest, I am unsure of the species. I think it might be some
species of pine but that is only a guess based on pictures online.

Before I get too deep into the coasters, I do want to plug the local
lumberyard I frequent, 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.moxonhardwoods.com/">Moxon Hardwoods</a>.

I'm fairly new to hardwoods and "exotic" woods especially. The folks at Moxon
were and are extremely nice and helpful with any questions I had. One of the
things I love most about them is they have what I call an "odds and sods" pile.
This wood isn't necessarily scrap, but is usually in shorter lengths and harder
for them to sell. I've seen this sold as "mill ends" some places.

This is perfect for folks like me because I can get a nice variety of woods
at a decent price. If you live in Portland, Oregon or the surrounding areas, I
can't recommend Moxon Hardwoods enough. Now onto the project.

## Hey, careful man, there's a beverage here!

I started the coaster set by cutting
square blocks that were about 7/8" wide and 5" long. I then glued these up
in sets of three and alternated between walnut and mahogany. I made
two sets that were walnut-mahogany-walnut and one that was 
mahogany-walnut-mahogany to achieve a chess board pattern.

After finishing the main block, I thought the coaster was a bit small
at just under 3" and decided to add a border. I'm not 100% sure on the species
of this wood, but it has a beautiful grain so I decided to try it.

If anyone happens to know exactly what this species is, please

I will also post my twitter handle at the end of the article, and it can also be
found in the footer.

I'll admit I did eyeball the border cuts. There is a mark on my miter saw that
I use that is between 5/32nds and 3/16ths. While each cut wasn't exactly the same
size, the difference was negligible to me.

After gluing the border on, I was
left with a beautiful, solid block of wood ready to be sliced into coasters.

Before slicing, I gave the block a rough sanding with 60 grit sandpaper to 
try and even everything out the best I could.

After gluing all this together, the end obviously wasn't flat and I decided to
take a test cut at the same mark I used for the border cuts.

I did this for two reasons. 1) This gave me a flat face on the block, and 2) It
allowed me to test the thickness of each coaster.

I thought that was too thin so I decided to bump it up to 1/4" to allow for a
bit of sanding. This seemed thick when measuring but turned out to be a great
thickness for them.

I ended up with about 12 coasters and some of the block leftover. I currently
only have a miter saw, and the block started to get small and I didn't feel
comfortable moving my hand closer to the blade.

I wanted a rough idea of what they would look like finished, so I rubbed one down
with a wet rag. I liked what I was seeing.

  </a>
</div>

I sanded the first coaster to 800 grit and applied a heavy coat of boiled
linseed oil with a rag. I let this sit for about 20 minutes, then I rubbed
off the excess oil with another clean rag. The next day I lightly sanded the
coaster again with the 800 grit sandpaper. I then followed the same procedure
as before to apply a second coat. I've considered a third coat, but am sticking
with two for the time being.

I'm getting the light so I think that's my time. All in all, I'm very happy with
how these coasters turned out. There are things I could have done differently
and probably better, sure, but I think they look great and I also learned some
things.

of pine.
